* Go on the following path in the current repo: $cd %PATH TO REPO%\IndrectDisplayDriver\IddSampleDriver.sln --- OR --- Double click on the 'IddSampleDriver.sln' solution
* Right click on 'IddSampleApp' OR 'IddSampleDriver' and simply select on 'Build' 
* This instantly builds the two files

Now, please follow the 'RUN_README.md' file for running the 'IddSampleApp' after installing Idd Driver (available on that README)
